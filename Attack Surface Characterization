In light of the recent Salt Typhoon attacks on U.S. telecommunications infrastructure, I decided to take a stab at summarizing the traditional attack surface for a mobile device. At some point I will reference the various attack scenarios with some variety of open source intelligence (articles, whitepapers, journals). I am approaching the mitigation strategy from the perspective of a corporate entity.

[Compromise of hardware]

Compromise of hardware design or fabrication supply chain
Difficulty: 10/10
Mitigation: incumbent upon vendor

Compromise of hardware design or fabrication supply chain
Difficulty: 10/10
Mitigation: buy directly from vendor

Exploitation of unknown hardware vulnerabilities
Difficulty: 9/10
Mitigation: keep hardware current

[Compromise of operating system]

Compromise of operating system supply chain
Difficulty: 10/10
Mitigation: incumbent on vendor

Exploitation of unknown operating system vulnerabilities
Difficulty: 8/10
Mitigation: keep operating system software current; monitor for jailbroken devices

Compromise of keychain while in an unencrypted state ("after first unlock")
Relevant: https://naehrdine.blogspot.com/2024/11/reverse-engineering-ios-18-inactivity.html
Difficulty: 9/10
Mitigation: ?

[Compromise of application software]

Compromise of application storefront
Difficulty: 10/10
Mitigation: incumbent upon vendor; use corporate storefront

Compromise of application delivery protection/integrity mechanisms (e.g., code signing)
Difficulty: 10/10
Mitigation: incumbent upon vendor

Exploitation of Appleâ€™s third-party application vetting processes
Difficulty: 9/10
Mitigation: incumbent upon vendor

Exploitation of iOS software design by third-party application producers with malicious intent
Difficulty: 9/10
Mitigation: limit acquisition of software to reputable vendors

[Compromise of confidentiality of unencrypted voice telephony]

Interception of voice calls as raw signal.
Difficulty: Nation-state [1/10]; citizen [9/10]
Mitigation: Use applications for encrypted telephony.

Compromise of voice calls as they transit carrier networks.
Difficulty: Nation-state [4/10]; citizen [10/10]
Mitigation: Use applications for encrypted telephony.

[Compromise of confidentiality of unencrypted text messaging (i.e., SMS)]

Interception of data between mobile device and tower.
Difficulty: Nation-state [1/10]; citizen [9/10]
Mitigation: Use applications for encrypted messaging.

Compromise of text messages as they transit carrier networks.
Difficulty: Nation-state [4/10]; citizen [10/10]
Mitigation: Use applications for encrypted messaging.

Compromise of confidentiality of encrypted voice telephony or encrypted text messaging

Interception of data between mobile device and tower.
Difficulty: Nation-state [1/10]; citizen [9/10]
Mitigation:

Compromise of encryption on the data network.
Difficulty:
Mitigation:

SIM/e-SIM hijacking.
Difficulty: [4/10]
Mitigation: Set SIM PIN.

Unauthorized number porting.
Difficulty: [6/10]
Mitigation: Set carrier PIN.

Carrier settings manipulation
Difficulty:
Mitigation:

Account takeover through password guessing.
Difficulty: [1/10]
Mitigation: Enable SMS with a passkey*
*Sadly not all carriers allow this
